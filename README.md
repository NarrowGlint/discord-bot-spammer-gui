# Discord Bot Spammer GUI
## Description
This program is a Discord Bot Spammer that connects to a server, than can send text (soon images) to a channel over and over again using discords API. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+ (Dog just get the newest version)
* discord.py (pip install discord.py)
* Beautiful Soup 4 (pip install bs4)
* Requests (pip install requests)

## Use
* Put all of your tokens in tokens.txt
* Edit pythoncommand.txt to fit your python command (default is 'python')
* Run start.bat
* Enter the last numbers of the discord invite and click join (ONLY IF THE BOTS HAVENT JOINED THE SERVER BEFORE)
* Click start to start spamming and stop to end it. (the stop button just ends all tasks named 'python.exe'. this may have to be adjusted for linux.)
NOTICES: Currently only the text spammer works. I will work to update and add support for the imager spammer.
